First steps
===========

Let us first try if everything is installed correctly by running an example simulation. 

1. make sure that the navground libraries are in the path (source `setup.*` and/or modify the path of you environment). 

2. launch CoppeliaSim, open one of the example scenes:
   
   - ``scenes/example_core.ttt``: uses APIs from ``navground_core`` to move discs between waypoints,
   
   - ``scenes/example_sim.ttt``: uses APIs from ``navground_sim`` to move discs between waypoints, optionally recording their trajectories

3. play the simulation. 


.. note:: 

   You find more realistic example controlling a robot in `navground_demo <https://github.com/idsia-robotics/navground/tree/main/navground_demos>`_.
