Introduction
============

`Navground <https://idsia-robotics.github.io/navground/>`_, short **Nav**\ igation Play\ **ground**\ , is a playground to experiment with navigation algorithms.

This package provides a `CoppeliaSim <https://www.coppeliarobotics.com>`_ plugin that exposes a lua interface to navground C++ library.

Using the plugin, you can use navground to let CoppeliaSim agents/robots navigate and avoid obstacles using any navigation behavior implemented in navground. Moreover, you can setup and record navigation experiments in HDF5 files.
